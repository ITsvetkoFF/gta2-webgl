gta2-webgl
==========

Why not port GTA2 to webgl? That's a great idea.... 


## Lets run it!
cd to server and run `node server` and launch your browser (chrome)

## Files needed from GTA2
We can't include the original map files from GTA2. So find them yourself... You will need the file 
- MP1-comp.cmp *(its the map)*
- bil.sty *(i'ts the style)*
